            <div class="story-body">

                <p>There is no way to describe nightfall in a frozen desert. The sensation of the first night is marked within you forever. As the heat bleeds away, the cold cuts to the soul; with every breath, the frigid air drives itself to the core. The skin turns to stone, cracks, becomes part of the very ground underfoot.</p>

                <p>It was at this hour, with the reddened light of the dying Sun disappearing, that Antonio shifted restlessly in his tent, wiped his face with a scrap of cloth, and said with contempt:</p>

                <p>— Hey, hey John. I heard a butterfly destroyed a colleague's tent. Did you hear about it?</p>

                <p>No answer. Only a breathing echoed inside the tent.</p>

                <p>Antonio kept fidgeting on his improvised straw mat, unable to find a comfortable position for sleeping. He usually tried to talk until sleep arrived, but this trick never worked when his companion pretended not to hear anything.</p>

                <p>A strong breeze blew in the distance, laden with fine golden grains of sand that had once been the soil of a living forest, or the bed of a coloured sea. The fact was that no life now existed over such melancholy lands. Nothing existed there anymore.</p>

                <p>— We need to be careful. A butterfly might appear. And there's no man alive who can stop one.</p>

                <p>John, his captain, let out a groan and complained.</p>

                <p>— What an idiot you are, Antonio. How could an animal destroy a tent? A butterfly? That doesn't exist… That's the kind of thing invented for people like you.</p>

                <p>Without any hurt feelings, Antonio withdrew into himself and lamented that his campaign companion was so unbelieving. Ah! He couldn't understand how anyone could not fear butterflies. Many years ago, when he was just a child, he had listened to endless stories about animals, magic, science and miracles.</p>

                <p>And insects. Insects were among the most fabulous creatures… They said that butterflies, enormous beings with coloured wings, imprisoned the wind. That made sense. Why else would the wind, when it passed, show such tremendous fury and despair, carrying everything away? Clearly it could only be a desperate flight.</p>

                <p>As a teenager, he would sneak into the tavern, slipping behind the bar. He would steal between legs, pilfer glasses, and listen to the grown-ups with their great exploits. He heard about a group of hunters who had once found an entire lake, with enough water for dozens of people, when they noticed thousands of small blue beings flying like blades along the water's edge. Those diabolical beings protected the reservoir, preventing any man from approaching and quenching his thirst. Those beings had sliced the bolder hunters apart, without pity or remorse. Without doubt, terrifying stories that had frightened the young man who now, years later, could not understand how anyone had no interest in such things.</p>

                <p>Lost in his thoughts, hours passed before a sound called him back from his reverie. He flinched. A butterfly? No, a false alarm. It was only his companion's snoring. The adrenaline would soon fade.</p>

                <p>And so the childhood memory faded from Antonio's mind and his thoughts drifted once more. An enormous staircase appeared, silver, pointing toward a golden mountain where the wind was chained and where a peal of laughter echoed for thousands and thousands of kilometres.</p>

                <p>— The wind, the wind, I have to set it free — he murmured, eyes sealed shut.</p>

                <p>And in an instant he was shaken. The staircase was falling, he was falling with it, and before he met the ground, he saw his stern captain shaking him and shouting sharp orders to get up. He saw the Sun through a gap in the tent: the sky had become clear again and the orange once more prevailed.</p>

                <div class="story-separator">***</div>

                <p>— Look, John! In the distance… The mountain range. We can head southeast, and who knows, maybe we'll get there?</p>

                <p>Showing no enthusiasm whatsoever, John began to dismantle the tent rapidly, erase their traces, and set off walking without looking back. A long and tedious journey, alongside the spectre of slender pointed rocks in supplication to the sky. Sometimes Antonio would look in all directions hoping to spot some demon or magical tree, and he was always disappointed in this regard. Yet he never lost any kind of hope, not even the kind that concerned a change of attitude from the grim companion who refused to talk. "I'm walking beside a statue," he thought.</p>

                <p>The weather changed gradually as they climbed in altitude, and a haze of sand thickened little by little. Only hearing the wind, the echo, and their own breathing led them into a sad trance, as though no other purpose existed in life but to walk and walk.</p>

                <p>The height would have revealed a beautiful landscape, were it not for the constant fog obscuring the men's vision. They were exhausted. And it was at this point on the mountain, on the edge of a physical and mental abyss, that darkness fell again. The tent was pitched: a tiny, fragile point between sharp and jagged rocks.</p>

                <p>Antonio was never anything but agitated at night, but he gave up trying to talk or to shift until he found a comfortable position (always in vain). Everything suggested it would be just another normal, quiet night. But something rang out. Loud, beautiful, clean and alive.</p>

                <p>— WHAT WAS THAT? — Captain John startled.</p>

                <p>— I don't know, it sounds like the howl of a lone wolf…</p>

                <p>— A howl? Don't be absurd, there are no wolves out here.</p>

                <p>— Of course there are. And tonight is a full moon — Antonio answered, pleased finally to have a conversation. — The fire is going. There's nothing to worry about.</p>

                <p>Once again he was ignored, but he noticed his companion's agitation.</p>

                <p>John, in one abrupt movement, leaped from his "bed" and threw open the tent, facing the full moon… The full Moon!</p>

                <p>— Cursed Moon! — And he writhed, trembling, moaning. He hated seeing the Moon there, bright and white and imposing.</p>

                <p>— If you like, we can climb higher and reach it! — Antonio mocked, amused by his companion's strange fear.</p>

                <p>But John wept.</p>

                <p>His eyes became the perfect reflection of the moon, so wide and white. Down his cold brow, warm drops began to flow. He saw silhouettes of people through the mist. Yes, they were people — not rocks or stones — they were spectres! They wanted to reach him, to take hold of him! He could already feel their touches, their breath, their calls.</p>

                <p>He was transported to an old straw chair, still a child, listening to the sound of cards being slapped down on a table, to the grumbles and insults of old players challenging the boredom of the small village. Such a common sound, cut by a loud, beautiful, clean and alive sound.</p>

                <p>— Listen, my son John, are you listening?!</p>

                <p>— Yes. What is that, Father?</p>

                <p>— It's a beautiful symphony, isn't it, son?</p>

                <p>— A symphony, Papa?</p>

                <p>— Yes, one as ancient as life… What is as ancient as life? Do you know, my boy?</p>

                <p>No, he did not know.</p>

                <p>— Death is as old as life, my son… The symphony is wolves singing to death.</p>

                <p>He wanted his father to stop. He did not want to hear about life, death, or wolves, whatever they were. He wanted to go back to sitting and watching the flow of cards, and not think about his mother's recent death. He wanted to hide from grief.</p>

                <p>— The full moon, son. It is the dwelling place of the dead. The wolves know that their dead ancestors are in the moon, and they try to reach them with their howling… Our ancestors are there too, your mother is there… We cannot reach them, but they can reach us, if we climb high enough.</p>

                <p>Enough! The frightened child cried out at that moment. Enough! The child cried out on every night of the full moon when he heard his mother as a sweet murmur saying his name, and then on the nights when he heard his father's laughter, and on those when he heard the lament of old friends. Enough! John shouted, pushing Antonio aside, weeping, howling. Delirious, he leaped through the abyss cutting into the mist and, at last, vanished from this world.</p>

                <p>Antonio returned to the village, puzzling over how anyone could fear the full Moon and wolves — and not butterflies! How could someone leap to their death because of the Moon? Impossible… And so Antonio told everyone, gesturing, performing, reproducing sounds in minute detail, everything about the invisible and gloomy butterfly that had pushed his friend over the edge of the abyss.</p>

                    Author's Note: This is a truly old story, older than the date marked here (since that date is when I first published it, on WordPress). This story had already appeared on an older blog of mine, called "kerosene" (a terrible name, I know — I was a teenager), hosted on Motime, which was active until 2008. It was a time when I wasn't reading much science fiction or fantasy (perhaps only the classics, like Harry Potter). Strangely, I remember that during that period I was quite a fan of Russian short stories, especially Chekhov, so I'm not quite sure where this "magical realism" came from — a genre I got to know a little later (and which is perhaps my favourite).
