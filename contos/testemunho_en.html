            <div class="story-body">

                <p>Here I am, in a plastic bag, discarded on the pavement, awaiting my final end.</p>

                <p>The story of my existence passes through my memory. Crafted from the purest silver of Potosí, I was ornamented in Paris and exported to a fine boutique in the affluent quarters of São Paulo.</p>

                <p>I remember the pleasant face of that lady with her pearls, looking me over in the shop. "That one. You can wrap it." "Yes, a wedding gift."</p>

                <p>My life was one of parties and banquets. For years, I was called upon only for special occasions: I witnessed live pianos resonating through my metallic frame, I savoured caramelised <i>soupe à l'oignon</i> and sweet <i>panna cotta</i> in my concave body. I entered mouths that exhaled the scent of Havanas and cognac.</p>

                <p>But the banquets, once monthly, became bimonthly. Bimonthly turned to twice yearly. And the variety of ingredients diminished in the same proportion.</p>

                <p>Before I knew it, I was taken from my box only once a year. Reflecting shimmering lights in green and red, I had been reduced to serving layered dessert.</p>

                <p>My sisters, one by one, began to disappear. Sold, pawned, bartered, they said.</p>

                <p>Only I remained. I already expected my end.</p>

                <p>But a new turn of fate occurred. I began to be used again. I refused to think about what that bluish, acidic liquid was, placed into me with such venomous spirit. I fought with every molecule of my silver against the ruin and permanent stigma that toxic substance could inflict upon my body.</p>

                <p>Daily, my lady used me to mix that vile substance into juices, into desserts, into broths. I entered and left a mouth increasingly sick and addicted — a man's mouth.</p>

                <p>Until one day, at last, his body succumbed. In a final spoonful, I felt the epiglottis contort in delirium, the oesophagus regurgitate the crimson vomit, and his last breath mist my mirror.</p>

                <p>Well, I can already hear the rubbish lorry coming. The sole witness, I shall be purged into concealment.</p>

                    Author's Note: This is an old story, recovered by chance from a forgotten computer at my parents' house — still faithful to the old Windows XP. The narrative takes an unusual point of view: that of a spoon. Years later, I came across a blog on creative writing which mentioned that adopting the perspective of objects can be an excellent exercise in style. It is something I have explored very little — this may be my only story in that format — but it still intrigues me, and perhaps deserves to be revisited.

                    Translated with the assistance of Claude Sonnet 4.6 — <em>Translator's note: "Potosí" refers to the Bolivian city historically famous as one of the world's largest silver mining sites; "soupe à l'oignon" and "panna cotta" are kept in their original French and Italian as markers of the spoon's cosmopolitan, upper-class origins. "Pavê" (a traditional Brazilian layered dessert) has been rendered as "layered dessert" to convey the social fall from banquet cuisine to something humbler and domestic.</em>
