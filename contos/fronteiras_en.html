                <p>I no longer recognise this city, where I lived so much of my life. The streets, avenues and wide boulevards are the same. The colour and outline of the lake have not changed. But I see a storm coming. And in the gust that precedes it, ashes and fragments of confetti rise — with tiny, faded letters — piling up along the kerbs of the pavements.</p>

                <p>When I boarded the transatlantic plane, I was not thinking about contraband. I migrated as a tourist, enchanted by the outside world. At the airports of other countries, I saw newsstands with magazines and paperbacks for sale, people holding papers and debating over them. There was a verb for what they did with those written things. A verb no longer used in this city of mine.</p>

                <p>When I disembarked on my return, the airport officer calmly opened my luggage and plunged his gloved hands into my pockets. He asked me to remove my shoes, my glasses, my belt. Behind the buckle he found the drawing of the forgotten Verb. He reprimanded me: did I think they wouldn't find it?</p>

                <p>When I first arrived in this city, I must have been in my mid-twenties. I drove aimlessly along the wide, tree-lined streets and lost myself in the roundabouts, imagining the life I would have there. I had just graduated, and the new job promised great achievements and responsibilities. Easily enough, I grew accustomed to the cleaner air of that place, the bright and present Sun. In the sprawling metropolis where I was born, amid the chaos and desolation, I had smelled nothing but carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and urea. My eyes, dulled by the perpetual haze, saw only the monochrome and shadows.</p>

                <p>In other countries, the sky is bluer. The trees are greener. The water is more refreshing. In the plazas I watched children and dogs running freely, cheerful and eating sweets. Couples sat on benches and held each other close. There was a word for all that is natural, that springs from the soil, from the air, from the sea. What was that word — the one that no longer exists on this side of the border?</p>

                <p>I no longer recognise this city, where I lived so much of my life. The parks bear the same names; the planters on the pavements have the same square shape. But there is nothing in them. Only concrete. I see a storm coming. And in the gust that precedes it, ashes and fragments of flowers and stems rise — with tiny, red-earth dusts — piling up along the kerbs of the pavements.</p>

                <p>My disembarkation was quite easy: the airport officer stamped my passport and asked me to open my bag. He checked all the folders. Asked me to open my mouth and looked under my tongue and behind my teeth. In my throat, he saw the lost word tied there. He was displeased: did I suppose they wouldn't find it?</p>

                <p>I still don't know whether maturity comes in phases, through stumbles and pinches and regrets; or whether it happens all at once — abruptly, we stop being children. I remember the funerals of my grandparents, one by one. I recall the commotion and the public procession, televised with care whenever notable figures passed away.</p>

                <p>There were also place names — schools, libraries, bridges — baptised in honour of men and women of old, no longer present in the material world.</p>

                <p>In other countries, there were faces of people stamped on coins. There were statues of iron, marble and granite at great road junctions. I also visited picturesque places, with trimmed grass and flowers arranged carefully beside ornate headstones. Before them, relatives sat in silence. In other countries, people gathered around coffins, or painted themselves as skulls and celebrated through the streets. What, after all, were they doing? There were words for that relationship between the living and the dead, between present and past. I used to know them.</p>

                <p>I no longer recognise this city, where I lived so much of my life. I think I crossed a border beyond merely cartographic limits. Those are the same hills that have always been there; the mountain ranges that embrace the city are the same silhouette. But in the gust that precedes the coming storm, ashes and more ashes rise, blown from the chimneys of dozens of crematoria, piling up along the kerbs of the pavements.</p>

                <p>When I disembarked once more, the airport officer was respectful. He greeted me as a citizen of his country and searched me in silence. He looked through my luggage, my clothes. I passed through sniffer dogs. When they drew my blood, they saw in slides my red blood cells and white cells forming the lost words. He disapproved: did I think they wouldn't find them?</p>

                    Author's Note: This is a more abstract piece, and it emerged during an election period in Brazil, at a time of great confrontation between Bolsonaro, a far-right candidate, and Haddad, on the left of the spectrum. It seemed almost certain that Bolsonaro would win. I believe most people were living in a distinctly dystopian atmosphere.

                    Translated with the assistance of Claude Sonnet 4.6 — <em>Translator's note: "Superquadras" (a term specific to Brasília's modernist urban planning — large residential blocks with shared open spaces) has been rendered as "wide boulevards" to preserve the sense of spacious urban design without requiring an architectural footnote in the body of the prose. The three vanished words — reading/writing, nature, and death/memory — are left deliberately unnamed, as in the original.</em>
