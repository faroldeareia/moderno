            <div class="story-body">

                <p>No one knew her name. Or perhaps no one had ever needed to give her one. She had settled in the slender rift that lay between the universes of Existence and Non-Existence, in a space beyond Time. Within that space she had built her beautiful world. And waited.</p>

                <p>In her world, subtle mists of indigo light unravelled like currents, encircling a colossal tree. Its enormous roots sprawled freely beneath a lake whose small waves rocked in an endless attempt to cover the plant's finest filaments. And it was inside this great tree that she lived. Solitary throughout eternity, wrapped only in herself…</p>

                <p>Until someone knocked at her door.</p>

                <p>The small creature that visited her bore human features, despite her slight stature and strange clothes. She knocked anxiously at the circular hollow she imagined to be the entrance to the tree. She had no certainty that anyone still lived within — if anyone ever had. But she had to try.</p>

                <p>It was with great astonishment that the little creature watched the hollow vanish, as though it had never existed. Through the newly formed opening, she was met by a nebulous shape, formless and translucent, which slowly transfigured itself into something corporeal, with a faint semi-human outline.</p>

                <p>The small creature began to speak in a rush:</p>

                <p>— A thousand pardons, sir or madam, for not having introduced myself. How terribly rude of me! Well, my name is Dusk, daughter of Time.</p>

                <p>The Nameless figure raised a hand, which made the tiny creature fall silent at once. She delicately rotated her arm, gesturing inward toward the Tree-House. It was an invitation for both of them to come in, move to the middle of the room, and sit.</p>

                <p>The Nameless entity studied her visitor. She sensed in her the same vital essence that a deity of Time would possess. Without doubt, this was a creature of Time. But she sensed another essence as well… What was that other sensation? Had everything outside changed so much that she no longer recognised the Universe and the essence of its beings? Abruptly, she remembered that courtesy demanded she say something. It was indelicate to stare at others for too long. She mumbled, for she had nearly forgotten how to speak.</p>

                <p>— Who… Hmm! Who. Is. Who are you?</p>

                <p>— A thousand pardons, sir or madam, for not having introduced myself. How terribly rude of me! Well, my name is Dusk, daughter of Time.</p>

                <p>The Nameless nodded.</p>

                <p>— Then, Miss Dusk, to what do I owe such an unusual visit? — The Nameless entity managed to speak without stuttering, and even sounded amiable.</p>

                <p>— I did something… it was an accident. But I did something terrible. I altered the flow of the Gods. — The creature looked as though she might collapse into despair at any moment. She braced herself, expecting a scolding.</p>

                <p>The Nameless entity, however, merely rested her hand upon her chin. She immediately found the sensation of her own touch and her own form strange. She had grown unaccustomed to having a form. But she was more interested in the story.</p>

                <p>— Go on — she said.</p>

                <p>— My sisters and I love to play, you know… The Goddess of Life lets us play in her garden, with her Human creatures. We like to plunge down from the sky. We choose a random target and fall upon it; that way we abruptly change their destiny, we set the paths of improbabilities in motion. My father, Lord Time, gets very upset, but I think deep down he rather enjoys it.</p>

                <p>She paused in her account. Until now she had worn a timid smile, but all of a sudden her features hardened. She continued:</p>

                <p>— I didn't see. I swear I didn't see. One of Death's own daughters was going to embrace a Human. When I fell, I fell right on top of her. There should have been a human there, and by the time I realised I would miss my target, it was too late! I swear! And I crushed her. I didn't even know I could crush one of Death's children!</p>

                <p>The Nameless grasped the gravity of the situation. It was unheard of for a Dusk to impede Death's workings, but in a way, improbable events were precisely the fault of Dusk and her sisters. She reflected further on the problem that had been created and recalled the rules of Existence. Everything that exists must one day cease to exist, dissolving, dispersing. Life and Death are the same face; whenever something emerges or is born, a daughter of death is generated for it, exclusive to it. In other words, whenever Life generates a human, Death generates a shadow-daughter, who will pursue that human until she finds them. If Dusk had simply crushed that human's death-shadow, that human could never cease to exist.</p>

                <p>The little creature continued to lament. She had risen to her feet again, pacing in circles. Then she spoke once more.</p>

                <p>— I thought, "well, that's fine, the human can be immortal." That should actually be a good thing for them, shouldn't it? But no — my father was very, very angry. He explained to me that if the human never dies, the things that would have come after them will no longer arise, that all my father's work — Time's work — was in crisis and would have to be halted. I didn't understand a thing… But couldn't a new death-child simply be created for them?</p>

                <p>The Nameless entity, well-versed in the laws of the Universe, answered:</p>

                <p>— No.</p>

                <p>A new death-child cannot be created for them, because death cannot be created without life. It is always a consequence, an afterthought.</p>

                <p>And she continued her lesson:</p>

                <p>— Child — She paused to adjust herself, unaccustomed to sitting; having a body was intensely uncomfortable when there was no decent chair to sit in — Every flow of the Universe falls into disarray. It is not only the flow of that human's death which has been interrupted. But the flow of new lives that would have emerged afterwards. You have interrupted all the mutations and paths that would have sprung from that being, above all from their death. Every entangled destiny that depended on the meeting and parting with that human. Let me show you.</p>

                <p>And the Nameless walked out of the Tree. She chose a random leaf from a nearby hanging branch and gently set it on the surface of the lake. The tiny creature followed it with her eyes.</p>

                <p>Reflected in the mirror of the water, there was a calm man walking down a street, when in one sudden moment, his heart stopped beating. They saw a funeral witnessed by a grieving family, in one of those rare gatherings of relatives who had long since stopped being fond of one another. Then they saw at the burial the reunion of a man and a woman once estranged from each other, making their peace. They saw the children born of this reunion. A thousand years later, the genes of these children blended with thousands of other genes, and so came men and women who changed humanity. When these descendants reached the stars, they changed other civilisations not even human.</p>

                <p>The image in the lake showed the dead man's body transforming into calcium, water and iron; evaporating into nitrogen and methane, nourishing green grass and its microscopic beings.</p>

                <p>A century later, that grass had become a shrub, which in time became a tree. In a hundred thousand years, the descendants of that tree reproduced and changed, one by one. A dense forest arose, with new fruits, lives and colours yet unknown.</p>

                <p>Then the Nameless said:</p>

                <p>— This is the flow governed by your father, Time. But now this flow is no longer possible. No other flow is possible either, for every one of them foresees life and death, life and death, life and death, until all that exists has at last dissolved. None of them foresees only life, without death. Time becomes useless. Your father must be frozen, paralysed by the agony of having no further reason to exist. Death, Life, and all the other Gods as well — It was her obvious conclusion. And yet, within the rift, they could not feel what was happening outside and be certain.</p>

                <p>The entity realised that Dusk was more powerful than one might have imagined. She understood that the other essence she had sensed in her was her own. She was her daughter too. "I was reckless," she reflected.</p>

                <p>She looked at her enormous tree-house. She looked at the shimmering lights like mist around her. It was a beautiful world, this one she lived in. The roots grew from the universe of Existence, the crown touched the universe of Non-Existence. Her tree was the foundation, the bridge, and the bond between what exists and what does not, in that in-between space called the Rift.</p>

                <p>Dusk let out a small cry of fright when she saw the Nameless lean against the tree and undo it. The tree, little by little, dispersed into mist. Without the Tree-Support, the rift began to shrink to the size of nothing, and the two universes transposed themselves, shattering everything that exists or ever could. The meeting of these two antagonistic universes was now unstoppable. Energy and matter fused; light and time faded. Before long, only the Void remained.</p>

                <p>— My daughter — She said — My name is Chaos. And you and I must begin everything again.</p>

                    Author's Note: This story was born from an image I had come across on DeviantArt. I was unable to find it again afterwards. It depicted an immense tree, solitary in the still mirror of a lake, with a tiny, almost ethereal figure standing before it. There was something in that scene that carried me back to Chrono Cross — one of the rare games I played on the old PlayStation 1. I remember venturing through its worlds without fully understanding the English, relying on tutorial guides that generous souls shared on the internet. Around the same time, I was immersed in the enchanted writing of Jack Vance. Between childhood memories, lost images, and Vance's prose, this story took shape.
