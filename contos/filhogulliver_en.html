            <div class="story-body">

                <p>Every night before bed, my father would tell me a short little story — some classic of children's literature — and close the evening by calling me his "Gulliver of Lilliput," giving me a pat on the head and turning off the lights. I never understood who Gulliver was, since he was never a character in any of the stories told.</p>

                <p>The following night, I would ask him to tell me the story of Gulliver. It was part of a mystery. I wanted to understand why my father called me that.</p>

                <p>But he never told it, always saying he would do so on some future night. In the meantime, he entertained me with "Tom Thumb," "Aladdin," "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" and so many others. Never the one I most wanted: the story of Gulliver of Lilliput himself.</p>

                <p>I imagined that my father was not a well-read man, nor a literary one, and so he could not summarise a longer story as Gulliver's perhaps was, falling back on stories made for children. Be that as it may, night after night, I waited for the story.</p>

                <p>Until, at last, I grew up. There were no more bedtime stories.</p>

                <p>Years later, on my way to university, I bought the book <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> at one of those street fairs. It was a book with a simple red hardcover, well-worn.</p>

                <p>I carried it to the shelf in my room, to the dining table, to the living room sofa. I memorised the size of the book, its weight, the thickness of the cover, the gleam of the embossed title. But I never opened it.</p>

                <p>Afterwards I graduated, moved to another city. I had long since stopped carrying the book around and never brought it to my new home.</p>

                <p>One ordinary day, a Sunday of no particular importance, with the sound of drizzle sprinkling against the windows, I dozed off. I had a strange dream.</p>

                <p>I dreamed that I had a son, already grown, who had been shipwrecked. He spent days clinging to a piece of timber, until the currents carried him to a shore. I followed him from a distance, like an observing narrator who could do nothing, watching him lying stretched out on the beach of an exotic island until he was found by diminutive men and women.</p>

                <p>They bound him and presented him to the King. I witnessed it all, powerless: my son, a giant, becoming the protector and beloved of the population for as long as he was useful. But when he refused to be cruel in a war between the small folk, he was hunted, imprisoned, seen as an aberration. He had to return to the open sea, exiled toward new lands.</p>

                <p>It could have been an ordinary dream. But I woke with sand between my toes and a strong smell of the sea throughout the house, which creaked like a boat. I woke with a powerful feeling of pride and dread for a dreamed-of son.</p>

                <p>That evening, my wife returned home and went straight to the bathroom. We had been worried; for days she had been suffering from a strange nausea. When she came out, I saw in her eyes an expression I had never witnessed before. She announced to me that she was pregnant.</p>

                <p>The lost story then came to light. I rested close to my wife's belly and whispered: "hello, Gulliver of Lilliput."</p>

                    Author's Note: This is a more abstract piece, and a more personal one. My father used to call me "Gulliver," so I always liked that story. I thought of using it as a premise for some tale, and this one emerged. It is not a story that reaches very far outward, toward readers — it is something more internal to me.
